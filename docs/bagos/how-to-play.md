# How to Play

- The objective of the game is to be the last player with dice remaining by successfully bluffing or challenging other players' bids.

### 1. Rolling Dice

- At the start of each round, all players roll their 3 dice in secret, keeping their dice hidden from others.

### 2. Bidding

- The first player makes an opening bid, stating a quantity and a face value (<span style={{backgroundColor: "#25c2a0", color: '#fff'}}>**e.g. "three 4s"**</span>). 
This bid represents their claim that there are at least that many dice showing that face value among all players' dice combined.

Note: Ones (1s) are jokers and count as any face value unless the first bid is on ones, in which case ones are only counted as ones for that round.

### 3. Subsequent Bids

- Play proceeds clockwise and each player must make a higher bid than the previous one by either increasing the quantity of dice for any face value, or keeping the quantity the same but increasing the face value.

<span style={{backgroundColor: "#25c2a0", color: '#fff'}}>**Example: if the previous bid was "three 4s," a valid next bid could be "three 5s" or "four 2s," but not "two 6s."**</span>


### 4. Challenging a Bid

- Instead of bidding, a player may challenge the previous bid by calling "liar" or "bluff."
- All players then reveal their dice.
- Count the number of dice showing the face value of the last bid, including ones (jokers).
- If the actual count is equal to or greater than the bid, the bidder wins; the challenger loses one die.
- If the actual count is less than the bid, the challenger wins; the bidder loses one die.

### 5. Losing Dice and Eliminations

- The player who loses the challenge removes one die from their set.
- If a player loses all their dice, they are eliminated from the game.

### 6. Starting the Next Round

- The player who won the challenge in the previous round starts the bidding in the next round.

### 7. Winning

- The game continues until only one player has dice remaining. That player is the winner.

:::tip[Additional Notes]

- Players must keep the value their dice hidden (hide the screen of your phone) except when a challenge is called.
- The game is best played with 3 or more players.
